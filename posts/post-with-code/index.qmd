The problem:
Making Python code interact with an SQL database is pretty straightforward.
For instance, with pyodbc we can do

```{Python}
import pyodbc
cursor...
```

But consider a complex program that has to do multiple SQL queries to fill in a database.
Importantly, an entire program run has to be committed together to SQL, or you risk data integrity issues (like for patients).
